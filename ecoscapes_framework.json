It breeds in shallow ponds and lakes, laying eggs singly or in small clusters attached to submerged vegetation. Larvae are aquatic, while adults are terrestrial and nocturnal, sheltering under logs, rocks, and leaf litter. These salamanders are active in spring and fall, often migrating short distances between breeding and foraging habitats. Their permeable skin makes them highly sensitive to pollutants and moisture loss.",

Garter snakes are active during the day and hibernate communally in winter, sometimes in large numbers.

Found in remote mountainous and forested regions of British Columbia, grizzlies are solitary and wide-ranging, with home ranges spanning hundreds of square kilometres. They play a keystone role in ecosystems by turning over soil, dispersing seeds, and regulating prey populations. Grizzlies enter hibernation from November to April, and like black bears, undergo hyperphagia in late summer, consuming up to 20,000 calories daily to prepare for winter.",

It breeds in shallow ponds and lakes, laying eggs singly or in small clusters attached to submerged vegetation. Larvae are aquatic, while adults are terrestrial and nocturnal, sheltering under logs, rocks, and leaf litter. These salamanders are active in spring and fall, often migrating short distances between breeding and foraging habitats. Their permeable skin makes them highly sensitive to pollutants and moisture loss.",

Unlike many amphibians, Ensatinas do not have an aquatic larval stage, they hatch directly from eggs laid in moist terrestrial microhabitats. These salamanders breathe through their skin and require cool, damp environments to survive. They are nocturnal and secretive, sheltering under logs, leaf litter, and rocks during the day.",

Larvae are aquatic, while adults are terrestrial and nocturnal, sheltering under logs, rocks, and leaf litter.

Specific interventions can include installing wildlife crossings (overpasses and underpasses) on roads, removing unnecessary fences, and restoring habitat within narrow corridor sections.",
