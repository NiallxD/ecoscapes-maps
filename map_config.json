The overlay references existing zoning or resource development plans and prioritizes the management of more restrictive land-use activities within zones with moderate and high connectivity potential. It also helps to increase awareness and understanding of ecological connectivity within the community.",

Males are considerably smaller than females. They are highly adaptable and often found near water, where they hunt amphibians and small fish. Garter snakes are active during the day and hibernate communally in winter, sometimes in large numbers. They give birth to live young and use their keen sense of smell and tongue-flicking to locate prey. In BC, several subspecies exist, including the common western garter and the more aquatic valley garter. In the Sea-to-Sky the most frequently seen is the common garter snake.",
